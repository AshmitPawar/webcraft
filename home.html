<h1 style="text-align:center"> Introduction to HTML: Understanding Basic Tags and Attributes </h1>
<div style="font-size:25px;">
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used for designing and structuring web pages on the internet. It provides a standardized way to organize and present content using predefined elements known as tags.<br> These tags define the purpose and structure of various components such as headings, paragraphs, images, tables, forms, and hyperlinks.<br> HTML tags are written within angle brackets and generally consist of an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag, ensuring proper structure and readability of web content.<br>
In addition to tags, HTML makes use of attributes, which supply extra information about an element and control its behavior or appearance. <br>Attributes are always placed inside the opening tag and are written as name-value pairs. Common examples include defining the source of an image, setting the width and height of elements, or specifying the destination of a link. <br>By using appropriate tags and attributes, developers can create well-structured, user-friendly, and accessible web pages. <br>A clear understanding of basic HTML tags and attributes is essential for anyone beginning their journey in web development, as it forms the foundation for learning advanced web technologies.

<h1 style="text-align:center"> Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets(CCS) </h1>
<div style="font-size:25px;">
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and visual appearance of web pages. <br>While HTML is responsible for the structure of a website, CSS is used to define how that structure looks, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design.<br> CSS allows developers to separate content from design, making websites more organized, consistent, and easier to maintain.<br>
CSS works by applying selectors to HTML elements and defining styling rules using properties and values.<br> These properties control various visual aspects such as text color, background color, font size, margins, padding, borders, and positioning<br>. CSS can be applied in different ways, including inline styles, internal style sheets, and external style sheets, with external CSS being the most efficient and professional approach for large projects. <br>By using CSS, developers can ensure uniform styling across multiple web pages, improve user experience, and create responsive and visually appealing websites. <br>Understanding the basics of CSS is essential for modern web development, as it plays a crucial role in enhancing the design and usability of web applications.<br>

<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:30;"> Introduction to Javascript and basics </h1>
<div style="font-size:25px;">
<p>JavaScript is a powerful and widely used programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.<br> While HTML provides the structure and CSS controls the visual presentation, JavaScript is responsible for handling user interactions and making web pages responsive and functional.<br> It enables features such as form validation, interactive buttons, dynamic content updates, animations, and real-time data processing without reloading the page.<br>JavaScript works by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing developers to modify HTML elements and CSS styles dynamically based on user actions. <br>It supports variables, functions, conditional statements, loops, and events, making it suitable for both simple and complex web applications.<br> JavaScript can be used on the client side to improve user experience and on the server side with technologies like Node.<br>js to build scalable applications. Understanding the basics of JavaScript is essential for modern web development, as it bridges the gap between static web pages and fully interactive web applications.<br>
